## How to Install and Run
First Clone the Repo and cd into it
`gitclone https://github.com/mkowusujr/sneakerhead-shoe-estore.git`

Next run `pip install -r requirements` in your commandline. You can do this in a python virtual environment to keep the versions of the dependices isolated in the project folder and not affect the depencies of any other python projects you may have on your system.
